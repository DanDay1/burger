"Cheesy Burger"


Cheesy Burger is a fun vertual resturant that allows users to build and davour virtual burgers. 


The user enters a name for their burger item, and the new entry is added into a MySQL database. When the user hits the "devour" button, the burger is moved to the devour collumn on the screen and its status is subsequently updated in the database. 


The front end templating is done using Handlebars.
